					  <p class="text"><b>June 27, 2024</b>
					    Here is the prediction for the UEFA EURO 2024 elimination round conducted at ICS-FORTH.
					  </p>
					  <p>Our PhD student Lucia computed 1 million predictions, once considering team performance during the group phase and
					    once also considering qualifier performance - keep in mind that Germany (host) did not play qualifiers.</p>
					  <p>The <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11222-023-10246-y">code and method was developed</a>
					    by current ICS-FORTH PostDoc Ben with Alexander Jordan at HITS.
					  </p>
					  <p>The advantage of our approach is that it can compute the HUGE prediction variance caused by tiny changes in estimated team strengths.
					    </p>
					  <p>We also computed exact win probabilities (without variance) using the <a href="https://www.zeileis.org/news/euro2024/">highly elaborate pre-group phase team strengths</a>
					    from our dear colleague Achim Zeileis.</p>
					  <p>Of course, as every year, our prediction will be wrong, since football is so unpredictable or to quote Jürgen Wegmann "Zuerst hatten wir kein Glück, 
					    und dann kam auch noch Pech dazu." - "First we were unfortunate and then we had bad luck".</p>
					  <p>The prediction and method was <a href="https://www.dnews.gr/eidhseis/science/479023/enas-algorithmos-provlepei-ton-nikiti-tou-euro-2024">also covered</a> by Greek science journalist Vasiliki Michopoulou.</p>
